This is a gross oversimplification and I'm sure I'm missing some steps...

That said, after you've cloned the repo here's some initial steps: 
* Make sure you have Xcode and Android Studio installed among other things.
* Follow install instructions at https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started
* I have been using VSCode for development, but you can use any IDE.
* Using command line/terminal, navigate to your project root directory.
* Run `npm install` if you have recently pulled any changes.
* Be running your emulator (via xcode or android studio) before running the command below.
* Start the app with `react-native run-ios` or `react-native run-android`
* NOTE: the first time you run one of those commands it takes a long time.  
* NOTE: Leave open the package launcher terminal window that opens when the process is done.
